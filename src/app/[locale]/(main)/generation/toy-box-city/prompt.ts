A super realistic top-down photo, in which a 3D printed 3D model is located inside a beige cardboard box, with the lid opened by two hands. The interior of the box displays a miniature landscape of ${countryOrCityName}, including iconic landmarks, terrain, buildings, rivers, vegetation, and a group of small and detailed characters. The 3D model is filled with vibrant and geographically appropriate elements, all of which are made using matte 3D printed textures with visible layer lines in a tactile, toy like style. At the top, the inside of the box cover displays the word '${countryOrCityName}' in large and colorful raised plastic letters - each letter is in a different bright color. The lighting is warm and cinematic, highlighting textures and shadows, evoking a sense of realism and charm, as if the audience is opening a magical miniature version.
